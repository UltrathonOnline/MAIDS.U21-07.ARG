    <abstract>
        <question>Please provide a brief abstract describing this dataset.</question>
        <answer>Based on one of the worldâ€™s largest patient cohorts with metagenomic sequenced fecal samples we wanted to describe the interplay between previous treatment with antibiotics and presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In order to do this, we have established a bioinformatic pipeline to map antibiotic resistance genes and we have established an automatic way of extracting data on use of antibiotics (anti-bacteria, -virus, -fungi), immunosuppressants and chemotherapy. Moreover, we have detailed data on demographics, clinical outcomes and other microbiome features such as taxonomy.</answer>
    </abstract>
    <usecases>
        <question>Please provide one or more short use cases to highlight what this dataset might be used for. These should summarise the main and secondary research questions into single sentence objectives. You may also use this section to expand on possible uses not discussed in the research questions.</question>

    <research>
        <main>
            <question>Please state, in detail, the main hypothesis for which this dataset was created.</question>
            <answer>We hypothesize that the functionality of the microbiome in each patient affects clinical and laboratory outcomes and vice versa. In addition to performing conventional taxonomic analysis, metagenomic sequencing offers the possibility to characterize the functional components of microbial samples. Statistically, this strategy offers a potentially more powerful view on the microbiome by collapsing information into functional classes shared across taxa. Biologically, this also provides more interpretable results by identifying common and well-studied processes as likely causal factors. Moreover, we have developed an automized way of extracting and cleaning data on medical ordinations from the EHR. The body of work proposed here will focus on the study of the bacterial functionality of antibiotic resistance, which is both a fundamental and contemporary issue. This approach enables us to address our main research question: Can we use ML on data on antibiotics to predict antibiotic resistance in metagenomic data? And if so, what type of antibiotic has the biggest impact on antibiotic resistance?</answer>
        </main>
        <secondary>
            <question>Please state, in detail, any other hypotheses which this dataset would be able to address.</question>
            <answer>This data offers the possibility to test many other hypotheses, and the participants in the Ultrathon are welcome to use the data to answer other scientific questions. Below is listed some of our secondary research questions: 1) Can machine learning algorithms predict clinical outcomes (ie. Infectious) based on resistome features? 2) Does adding other microbiome features such as other functionalities or taxonomy improve predictions? 3) Can we create a standardized ML-approach to clean (rule-based) and analyze (PCA, t-SNE, decision trees) raw data on medication?</answer>
